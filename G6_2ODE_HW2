    %where 'flag' denotes the location where parameters are set
        %INPUT parameters:
        %k1 is the infection spread rate
        %I_max is the maximum number of infected cells 
        %k2 is the killing rate of infected cells by CD8 T cells
        %k3 is the antigen driven CDT8 cell proliferation rate 
        %k4 is the antigen driven CDT8 cell proliferation rate 
        %kp is the  antigen driven proliferation threshold
        %ke is the antigen driven suppresion threshold
        %phi_n  is the NK cell activation rate 
        %zeta is the efficacy of NK cell suppression of CD8 T cell proliferation
        %phi_e is the NK cell efficacy threshold 
        %gamma is the rate of elimination of infected cells by NK cells 
        %a is the rate growth cytokine pathology 
        %dc is the rate of loss of cytokine pathology
